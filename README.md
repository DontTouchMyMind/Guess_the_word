#### About project
The project is implemented in the Python programming language.

This is my training project, an assignment I completed after learning OOP principles in Python.
I am practicing creating my project on GitHub. 
I work with GitExtensions in first time 
and learn how to properly execute commits with reference to specific tasks in the project.

This is a simple task and the solution is very simple. The solution is made in the OOP method. In the future, the tasks will be more complex, and the code will be more detailed with a division into the client part and the class API itself.
